You may find that your quick wit and charm will help you in obtaining allies. You will get bored quickly, so make sure that you have scheduled enough activity to hold your interest.", "You have two choices; Get out on your own, or bend to others' whims. Get busy on those home improvement projects that you've been procrastinating about. Put your thoughts into action.", "Get back into the swing of things. You may be the recipient of false information. Someone you least expect could be trying to make you look bad.", "Your charm and generosity will bring new friends and romantic opportunities. This will not be the best day to try to push your ideas or concerns. Don't push your luck with authority figures.", "Creative endeavors will give you somewhat of an outlet. Try to curb overindulgence today.
